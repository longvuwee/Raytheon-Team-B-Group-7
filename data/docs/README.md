# Folder: docs

## 📌 Purpose
This folder contains project documentation, including design decisions, system architecture, methodology notes, and references. It serves as the knowledge base for both developers and stakeholders.

## 📂 Contents
- **architecture/** → system and infrastructure diagrams (PNG/SVG/PDF).  
- **api/** → API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger, endpoint docs).  
- **design/** → Figma exports, design tokens, UI mockups.  
- **methodology.md** → explains modeling approach, data pipeline, evaluation metrics.  
- **user-guide.md** → instructions for end-users of the standalone app.  
- **developer-guide.md** → setup, contribution guidelines, code style notes.  

---

## ⚙️ Usage
- Refer to `architecture/` when onboarding to understand how frontend, backend, and datasets interact.  
- Consult `api/` for REST/GraphQL API details when integrating or debugging.  
- Use `design/` for UI/UX references from Figma.  

---

## 📑 Notes
- Keep diagrams in editable formats (e.g., `.drawio` or `.fig`) alongside exported `.png/.svg`.  
- Update methodology docs whenever the modeling pipeline changes.  
- Sync design assets with Figma regularly.
